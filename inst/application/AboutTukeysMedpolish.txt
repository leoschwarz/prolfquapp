Tukey's median polish is a statistical technique that helps extract median values from data by iteratively removing the median contributions from various factors. In this context, it's used to derive an estimate of protein abundance from the peptide-level data.
The inferred protein abundance, as computed through the Tukey's median polish method, can be thought of as an approximation to the median of the peptide intensities within a given sample. This provides a representative measure of the protein's abundance in the sample.
