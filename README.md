[ASMS Poster pdf](https://github.com/wolski/prolfquapp/blob/master/inst/poster/prolfquapp.pdf)

## How to install


On Linux

```
export R_LIBS_SITE="/scratch/PROLFQUA/r-site-library/"
R --vanilla << EOF
.libPaths()
install.packages(c("remotes","seqinr", "prozor","logger"), repos = "https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/")
remotes::install_gitlab("wolski/prolfquadata", host="gitlab.bfabric.org")
remotes::install_github("fgcz/prolfqua", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("prolfqua/prolfquapp", dependencies = TRUE)
EOF
```


## How To use prolfquapp

After installation run from the command (bash cmd) line:
```
R --vanilla -e "prolfquapp::copy_shell_script()"
```

This will place the following files into your working directory:


```
[1] "/<working_directory>/CMD_DEA.sh"
[3] "/<working_directory>/CMD_MAKE_YAML.sh"
[4] "/<working_directory>/CMD_QUANT_QC.sh"
[5] "/<working_directory>/CMD_MAKE_DATASET.sh"
```

Afterwards on the command line give the executable permission (LINUX):

```
chmod a+x CMD_*
```

These 4 files help to exectute the following workflow:

1. `CMD_MAKE_DATASET.sh` creates a file where you provide the experiment annotation
2. `CMD_QUANT_QC.sh` creates QC reports for your experiment.
3. `CMD_MAKE_YAML.sh` creates the analysis configuration file, for the Differential expression analysis with default values and enables to adjust processing options (data transformation, aggregation etc)
4. `CMD_DEA.sh` runs the DEA analysis



All these files can be run with the option `--help`.


## Creating Experiment Annotation using CMD_MAKE_DATASET

CMD_MAKE_DATASET can be used to help you to create an prolfqua compatible annotation file.
It will look into the analysis results and extract the file/sample names.

After running your Quantification software, DIA-NN, MAXQUANT, FragPipe-TMT, FragPipe-DIA or FragPipe-LFQ,
the quantification results are in an `ouptut_folder`.
Please add the `.fasta` file which was used by the quantification software to the `output_folder`.


Now, to create a `prolfquapp` compatible experiment annotation file run:

```
./CMD_MAKE_DATASET.sh -i data_dir/ -s DIANN -d annotation.xlsx
```

The `annotation.xlsx` file will be generated, and you will need to fill out the missing columns.


### The prolfqapp Annotation

The `annotation.xlsx` file needs to contain the following columns:

- Relative.Path/Path/raw.file/channel/ (unique*)
- name - used in plots and figures (unique*)
- group/experiment - main factor
- subject/bioreplicate (optional) - blocking factor
- control - used to specify the control condition (C) (optional)

The column names are not case sensitive.

* If each row must contain a unique value (no duplicates per column)

If the experiment is not paired, or has no blocking factor (e.g. batch, cell line) delete the subject column.

## Running the QC.

The `CMD_QUANT_QC.sh` script will create a QC report for your data. The report consists of two HTML documents and XLSX file. 

```
./CMD_QUANT_QC.R -i data_dir/ -p ProjectName -w WorkunitName -d annotation.xlsx -s DIANN -o where_to_write_results
```

for more details about the options run './CMD_QUANT_QC.R -h'.


## Creating the prolfquapp configuration file

Using the `./CMD_MAKE_YAML.R` command line tool you can create the Yaml file you can use to set the parameters needed by the prolfqapp `CMD_DEA.sh` tool.

```
./CMD_MAKE_YAML.sh -y config.yaml
```

`CMD_MAKE_YAML.sh` has many more parameters which you can explore by running it with the `-h` option. They can be used to present values in the generated yaml file.


## Differential expression analysis using prolfquapp

Using the `./CMD_DEA.sh` you can analyse your data. The tool will generate an output folder containing, HTML documents, an XLSX file with the data, SummarizedExperiment.rds file, and txt or csv file which can be used to run GSEA or ORA analysis.

After setting the parameters in teh config.yaml file you can run the DEA analysis by:

```
./CMD_DEA.sh -i diann_output_dir/ -d annotation.xlsx -y conifg.yaml -w NameOfAnalysis -s DIANN
```

This will generate a folder which starts with "DEA_" and writes all the analysis results and used input data into it.





## ASMS poster abstract:  Streamlining Protein Differential Expression Analysis in Core Facilities



### Introduction

The prolfquapp is a user-friendly application to streamline protein differential expression analysis (DEA) in core facilities. The application leverages the preprocessing methods and statistical models implemented in the R package [prolfqua](https://github.com/fgcz/prolfqua). It generates dynamic HTML reports that contain quality control plots and visualizations of the DEA results. The prolfquapp also exports results in multiple formats, including XLSX files, .rnk or txt files for gene set enrichment analysis, and Bioconductor SummarizedExperiment format for import into interactive visualization tools like OmicsViewer and iSEE. The prolfquapp offers a comprehensive and efficient solution for researchers seeking to analyze protein differential expression data in a core facility setting.

### Methods

The prolfquapp is a highly configurable application. The application interfaces with the laboratory data management systems through a YAML file and a '.tsv' file. To showcase this functionality, we developed an R Shiny application that collects user inputs, generates the configuration files, and runs prolfquapp. The YAML file enables the specification of key parameters, such as data normalization and modeling methods. It can also contain information about the input data and project integrated into the HTML report. This makes prolfquapp a user-friendly and flexible tool for protein DEA.

### Preliminary data

We developed an application based on the *R* package for users unfamiliar with statistics and *R* programming to ease the usage barriers of the *prolfqua* package. Furthermore, we integrated it into the data management platform B-Fabric. This integration enables users to select the input data and basic settings in a graphical user interface (GUI).
Using sample annotation information stored in B-Fabric, the user creates a table with the following columns: the sample name, a column with the sample groupings, an optional column with an additional explanatory variable, and finally, a column that defines which group differences to compute. This file format is similar to the one used by SAINTexpress, MSstats, or LFQAnalyst. In addition, other parameters, e.g., which of the modeling methods implemented in the prolfqua R-package can be specified.
The application then generates multiple result files, including an HTML report. The report integrates project-related information from B-Fabric and introduces the DEA. Furthermore, QC plots and summaries focus on the quality of protein and peptide identification and quantification. Next, we show the results of the DEA using dynamic tables and figures, which can be queried and filtered. Finally, in the section on additional analysis, we introduce methods of downstream omics analysis, e.g., gene set enrichment analysis, and provide links to web services (e.g., Webgestalt, String-db). 
Most importantly, the user receives all the data and code to reproduce the analysis on his infrastructure. This way, prolfquapp, and B-Fabric help scientists meet requirements from funding agencies, journals, and academic institutions while publishing their data according to the FAIR data principles. The source code of the prolfquapp R package is available from https://github.com/wolski/prolfquapp.

### Novel aspect

The prolfquapp can be tightly integrated with the LIMS system, and, at the same time, You can replicate the analysis on your laptop computer. 


# Implementation

- Yaml file is generated either using a Shiny application or a command line application.
- The parameters of the application are stored in an R list

## Yaml file



## Annotation file

A data frame with the sample annotation must be provided

- column which allows to map channel or raw file names to the sample name and explanatory variables.
  - if TMT analysis workflow one column starting with "channel" (either upper or lower case), with the channel (FragPipeTMT)
  - if DIA or DDA workflow then one column named exactly "Relative.Path", containing the raw filenames. Eeach  file name must be unique.
- one column starting with "^name" which is a unique sample name. These names will be used to label figures.
- one column starting with "group|^bait|^Experiment" (either upper or lower case). 
- Optional : no or exactly one column name starting with "^subject|^BioReplicate" (either upper or lower case)
- Optional : no or exactly one column name starting with "Contrast" (either upper or lower case)
